- [1. Needed components](#1-login-to-sonarcloud-with-github-account)
- [2. Fork the project](#2-fork-the-project)
- [3. On sonarcloud select the repository you will check with sonarqube](#3-on-sonarcloud-select-the-repository-you-will-check-with-sonarqube)
- [4. Setup the join between IDE and sonarcloud](#4-setup-the-join-between-IDE-and-sonarcloud)
- [5. See what your code is about](#5-see-what-your-code-is-about)

So after this steps you can handle your code quality and see what you can do better or what is almost good.

# 1. Needed components

To work with the tutorial make sure you follow the steps below or [here](#https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/get-started-2-minutes/).

#### 1. Download the SonarQube Community Edition [here](#https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/) 
#### 2. Unzip it
#### 3. Start the SonarQube Server

#### 4. Log in to http://localhost:9000 with System Administrator credentials (admin/admin)
#### 5. Download MySQL / make sure to have it [MySQL-Downlaod](#https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
#### 6. Make sure to use Java 11
#### 7. Last one, make sure to have SonarQube Scanner and Server

# 2. fork the project

If you want to see your quality of code fork the project from your Software engineering project to have full access.

# 3. prepare your IDE and Gradle
In our example we analyze the code with gradle, because the project runs with gradle.
Read the steps on the [website](#https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+Gradle) or read below.

Add the following code snippet in your gradle.properties ->

"systemProp.sonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000
#----- Token generated from an account with 'publish analysis' permission
systemProp.sonar.login=<token>"
Also add to global build.gradle -> 
"plugins {
  id "org.sonarqube" version "2.7.1"
}"
